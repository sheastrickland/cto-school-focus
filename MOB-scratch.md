# Mob Programming
================
> ... also known as a team. You're already doing it, it's just *very* asynchronous and siloed.

## What is it?
same thing, same space, on the same screen.  It enables cross functional teams to make better decisions, produce better quality software, and collaborate effectively.

## Questions and Metrics
1. How productive is the team? (i.e. how much gets done per unit of time)
2. How high quality is the product? (not only customer facing quality but also code quality)
3. How much are team members learning? (do less experienced team members get mentoring)
4. How happy are the individuals on the team? (do you go home happier at the end of the day)

- Will it work if majority don't want to do it? 
    - Well, probably not, but only in the same way that solo players will avoid teams. 
- Less Hero's, less Rockstars, less ego... more team. Shared goals.
- Consensus, over conflict resolution. Two valid perspectives / solutions, process of picking which one to do.

## How did we get here?
- different software maturity levels 
- different experiences
- different skills and strengths
- different weaknesses
- different motivators
- working in pairs occasionally, was yielding a good shared understanding
- Solo diverges into silo's, leads to arguments

This all led to challenging interactions without a shared understanding of "how to software" and more importantly "how to people"

## Why do it
---------
- Typing isn’t the bottleneck in software development, and writing code isn’t building a product. The real cost is solving the problem, waste, and rework. 
- Continuous integration of ideas
- Hyper condensed feedback loop
    - Know when to park/table challenges
- Compressed retro
- Immediate code reviews
    - Thick skin, constructive only
- Without constructive debate 
    - you'll pick the least offensive solution
- The strengths of the whole overcome the weaknesses of the few
- Hiring is one of the toughest challenges we face, only going to get harder
    - Being able to parachute a keen graduate / hire into a team which solves problems together can really rapidly grow
- Death to Silo's
    - Knowledge silo's and special dev's for certain codebases disipates
- Mentor's and teachers will fall out the other side
- Coalesced knowledge
- When a production issue arises and a group form to tackle the problem, take all those good traits and translate it to building aswell

## How's
---------
- Attention spans differ
    - Tune in Tune out policy
- Language is key
    - No personal pronouns (1st 2nd 3rd). Almost always perceived negatively, and perception is king
    - Factual statements, don't try predict the motivators and presures of the past, just look forwards
    - Safe words, protocols
- No seagul comments, fly in, shit on, steal a chip and leave
- Interpersonal issues and friction had to be resolved. 
    - When interpersonal issues happened they get brought up much more quickly. In a ”normal team” when there are these types of interpersonal issues they are often allowed to fester.
- No idea how, it just does
- Good questions, lead to better questions
- Can 5 people create a more cohesive document independently?
    - Branch and merge when applicable
- This is Playdough, shape it to suit
- Solo never, if you have to, only the most experienced dev, and only the most trivial tasks

## Watch out for
- Confirmation bias
- Echo chambers
- Engagement
- Everything is amplified, even the negative. Learn to see it early

This is hard, teams are hard. This requires effort. Valuable, validated effort.
