#What is (status quo)
 - Metphor, all can relate to, Find things everyone share

*Me*
- Imposter syndome (different types)
  - Perfectionism — not recognising a success because you can only focus on the flaws
  - Overworking — can also be connected with perfectionism, as well as a way of avoiding finishing a project or product that will be judged
  - Undermining your achievements — pointing out your mistakes before taking ownership of a success, procrastinating and leaving things to the last minute, and then having to rush to finish
  - Fear of failure — putting off starting something, avoiding taking on new challenges and reluctance to ask for feedback as you can't face potentially failing
  - Discounting praise — pointing out other people's contributions before your own, assuming praise given is faked or exaggerated
- We're more than likely on the introverted side, so asking for help or outwardly celebrating a victory is difficult
- the more knowledgeable and experienced you are on a topic, the more you learn how much you have yet to learn, so your confidence in your knowledge actually falls after it initially rises.
- The human brain generally doesn't focus on good things because good things can't hurt us
- Be comfortable in the knowledge that any decision you make is wrong, given time.
  - Today's best solution, is tomorrows legacy
- Embrace refactoring, both code, architectures and thought patterns

*Team*
- Different principles, motivators, maturity in sotware development
- No one person can keep up
- overly strong opinions
    - silicon valley: tabs vs spaces
- typically polarising opinions
- Asking a question feels like it was a trade-off between not getting an answer or getting stabbed with the answer

*Tech*
- 1986 http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszcah/G51ISS/Documents/NoSilverBullet.html 
- Chasing tails
- Extreme dogmatism
    - Dogma
- oooh Shiny!
    - Over the hedge, Up dog (squirrel)
- Tech radars, like any radar... things enter the radar, and eventually leave it
    - Spaceballs
- Complexity, cost
- Promises
    - Tradeoffs

What could be (big gap, amplify)
 - Relate to metaphor
   
   - Experiments
     - Beware Survivorship bias
   - Brown bags
   - Scatter gather tests
   - Simplicity
   - growth mindset
   - help your peers, pull them up not push them down
   - evidence is the only real practice for imposter syndome, gather often

(back and forth, moving to the gap)

Resistance...
Call to action
Utopia, what could be
